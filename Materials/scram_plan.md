### -> create the gulp process  - done
### -> gather all the scripts (make a list of them and include them in the gulp project)
### -> after insertion of such scripts define the canvas that you are going to use for the entirety of the theme
### -> figure out the elements that will represent the general transition across all themes. (for example, the fullpagejs plugin)
### -> implement other commonly recurring elements such as the contact form and the timer
### -> find design materials (pictures, videos, audio files, etc)

## Some to do's:

    -> Add scss for font-awesome
    -> Add scss for ionicons
    -> Add scss for bootstrap
    -> Try to make a sass file out of the glitch effect transitions.
